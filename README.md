Roadmaps for Technologys


AI Roadmap:
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

IoT Roadmap:
To understand, what is Internet of Things(IoT)? Let us consider a simple real life example of an IoT based system. Suppose there is a water tank in a locality.The tank has to be filled twice in a day once in the morning at 5 AM, and once in evening at 4 PM. To pump water to the tank there is an electric motor that has to run for three hours to fill the tank. Let’s say a Mohan has the responsibility to operate the motor. To do this,he has to come from his home which is five Km away from the site. He has to visit there twice, switch on it and shutdown it after three hours. Now to make the system automatic, a system which can be operated with less human intervention, a micro-controller/microprocessor can be embedded in the electric motor, in order to monitor the system from far away, the system can be made internet connected. Now Mohan can operate and observe the status of the system from his home as well. Also sending a text message(SMS) or a Whats app message when water is filled will further enhance the operation of the system. Now this system will become an IoT system. Thus IoT is network of different devices like electric motar, home appliances, industrial appliances etc. containing sensors, related software and hardware, these devices are network/internet connected and capable to transfer and receive data with each other and capable to process and store data.

Robotic Roadmap:
Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. This field overlaps with computer engineering, computer science (especially artificial intelligence ), electronics, mechatronics, mechanical, nanotechnology and bioengineering.

Blockchain Roadmap:
A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). 


DevOps Roadmap:
A compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops), DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers.DevOps enables formerly siloed roles—development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security—to coordinate and collaborate to produce better, more reliable products. By adopting a DevOps culture along with DevOps practices and tools, teams gain the ability to better respond to customer needs, increase confidence in the applications they build, and achieve business goals faster.
